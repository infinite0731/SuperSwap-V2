SuperSwapV2 - UniswapV2 Clone - Built for educational purposes

SuperSwapV2 is a decentralized exchange protocol that allows for the swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is comprised of two main contract types: core contracts and periphery contracts.

The core contracts of SuperSwapV2 are responsible for managing the liquidity pools that enable token swapping. These contracts include the SuperSwapV2 Factory contract, which creates new liquidity pools for token pairs, and the SuperSwapV2 Pair contract, which represents a specific liquidity pool for a token pair. The Pair contract includes functions for adding and removing liquidity, as well as for swapping tokens between the pool and external wallets.

The periphery contracts of SuperSwapV2 provide additional functionality to the protocol, such as interfaces for querying token prices and liquidity pool information. These contracts include the SuperSwapV2 Router contract, which is responsible for routing trades between different liquidity pools, and the SuperSwapV2 Library contract, which contains reusable code for mathematical calculations used throughout the protocol.

Overall, SuperSwapV2 is a powerful decentralized exchange protocol that enables fast and trustless swapping of ERC-20 tokens, while also providing liquidity providers with a flexible and dynamic platform for managing their liquidity.
